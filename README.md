# open-minds-solution
Team Open Minds' main repository for the 2023 Engineering Hubs AI Jam hackathon.



- transcript bot is the /bot directory (not MSTeamsBot)
- i did most of the set up in the /bot README and i think it should be fine since its not local stuff, but maybe read through it (i think the ngrok url should work as long as i am running it?)
- navigate to /bot dir in terminal and `npm i` and `npm start` - this will start the bot 

- i think we need to figure out how to test locally and i haven't figured that out yet, so we can actually test the changes we are making to the bot code 

Testing in teams
- to start the Teams, open the /bot dir in another vs code window
- go to run and debug / Ctrl+Shift+D and choose (Launch Remote (Chrome)) and click green arrow (it will launch), you might need to install teams toolkit extension - but i think itll let you know in the console 
- login to teams with credentials
- there is already a meeting where i added the the bot, you can just join that meeting to test it
